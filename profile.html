    <h1>Welcome to Champions league page</h1>

    <br>

    <p>The UEFA Champions League is an annual club football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations and contested by top-division European clubs,<br>
         deciding the competition winners through a round robin group stage to qualify for a double-legged knockout format. 
        </p>

    <p>
        The first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, 
        when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Hearts 5â€“3.[11] The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[12] The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs.
